# *ev*funcs
Functions for working with files created by EvTAF and the evsonganaly GUI.  
In case you need to work with those files in Python ðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜Š (see "Usage" below).

The first work published with data collected using EvTAF and evsonganaly is in this paper:  
Tumer, Evren C., and Michael S. Brainard.  
"Performance variability enables adaptive plasticity of â€˜crystallizedâ€™adult birdsong."  
Nature 450.7173 (2007): 1240.  
<https://www.nature.com/articles/nature06390>  

These functions are translations to Python of the original functions 
written in MATLAB (copyright Mathworks) by Evren Tumer.

### Installation
`$ pip install evfuncs`

### Usage

The main purpose for developing these functions in Python was to 
work with files of Bengalese finch song in this data repository:  
<https://figshare.com/articles/Bengalese_Finch_song_repository/4805749>

Using `evfuncs` with that repository, you can load the `.cbin` audio files ...
```Python
>>> import evfuncs

>>> rawsong, samp_freq = evfuncs.load_cbin('gy6or6_baseline_230312_0808.138.cbin')
```

... and the annotation in the `.not.mat` files ...
```Python
>>> notmat_dict = evfuncs.load_notmat('gy6or6_baseline_230312_0808.138.cbin')
```
(or, using the `.not.mat` filename directly)
```Python
>>> notmat_dict = evfuncs.load_notmat('gy6or6_baseline_230312_0808.138.not.mat')
```

...and you should be able to reproduce the segmentation of the raw audio files of birdsong
into syllables and silent periods, using the segmenting parameters from a .not.mat file and 
the simple algorithm applied by the SegmentNotes.m function.

```Python
>>> smooth = evfuncs.smooth_data(rawsong, samp_freq)
>>> threshold = notmat_dict['threshold']
>>> min_syl_dur = notmat_dict['min_dur'] / 1000
>>> min_silent_dur = notmat_dict['min_int'] / 1000
>>> onsets, offsets = evfuncs.segment_song(smooth, samp_freq, threshold, min_syl_dur, min_silent_dur)
>>> import numpy as np
>>> np.allclose(onsets, notmat_dict['onsets'])
True
```
(*Note that this test would return `False` if the onsets and offsets in the .not.mat 
annotation file had been modified, e.g., a user of the evsonganaly GUI had edited them,
after they were originally computed by the SegmentNotes.m function.*)

The `evfuncs` functions are used in the 
[`hybrid-vocal-classifier`](https://hybrid-vocal-classifier.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) 
and [`songdeck`](https://github.com/NickleDave/songdeck) libraries.
